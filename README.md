## [Week 1: **Introduction with Scratch**](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week1)

The first day of school was both exciting and nerve-wracking.  I am excited because it's the start of a new learning adventure, meeting new people and making friends, but at the same time, nervous because I don't have any background about the course I'm taking. Will I be able to make it? Is it going to be difficult?
<br>

Encountering Scratch for the first time is a bit challenging. I followed the instructions and tried to work my way. It's funny and a shame when I asked my kids if they know what Scratch is all about to which they all said yes.  They explained to me that it's a site used by those who want to learn about programming. My second son showed it to me and explained some basic navigation. I was able to make my first "Hello World" project.  I thought to myself, I can handle it so I looked forward to making it to the next session.

## [Week 2: GitHub](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week2)

The first day is testing the water while the second day is dipping slowly into the water.  A new platform to learn! I was able to follow the instructions on how to use GitHub but at the back of my mind, what is this!?! What will I write? How will this be useful for me? Am I gonna drown soon in the shallow level of water?

<br>
I read the module and did my own research. I was able to create my repository in a website form. I'm hooked! This is what I like! From plain page to a more website-like one.  I was able to make different pages through links and was able to consolidate my thoughts. Hmmm... I can try to move further more and see how deep I can go....

## [Week 3: Python](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week3)

I've enjoyed the water, perhaps, I can explore and have more fun.  Introduction to the programming language, Python.  Just the word itself, I hate it! Hearing it jumpscare me as I can imagine the slimy-looking scales that give me goosebumps.  Will the "Python" be the same python, I'm dreading?
<br>

I was able to understand the discussion, the function and the data types but, as we go along with the coding, I am lost.  What's happening? Why did Sarmad use parenthesis and the quotation mark?  I am listening to the discussion but my brain is all twisted and going somewhere.  Is Sarmad speaking in an alien language? 
<br>

Thank God, the discussion is over.  I appreciate Sarmad's lecture. I know I understood it but I feel like I'm drowning in the water. I'm struggling but I am doing my best to survive. I know I will be able to get out of the water, with a brand new skill that I will carry with me forever.
