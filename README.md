## [Week 1: **Introduction with Scratch**](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week1)

The first day of school was both exciting and nerve-wracking.  I am excited because it's the start of a new learning adventure, meeting new people and making friends, but at the same time, nervous because I don't have any background about the course I'm taking. Will I be able to make it? Is it going to be difficult?

<br>

Encountering Scratch for the first time is a bit challenging. I followed the instructions and tried to work my way. It's funny and a shame when I asked my kids if they know what Scratch is all about to which they all said yes.  They explained to me that it's a site used by those who want to learn about programming. My second son showed it to me and explained some basic navigation. He reminded and reiterated to me _watch the tutorial_ to make it easy for me.

#### Learning:

To be able to copy the respondent's answer, set the variable and concatenate. I set the variable name = answer.  The tutorial showed how I can create a background which is easy as I only have to choose from the options provided.  I learned that you can add a sprite (character) to make an animated conversation which I tried. 

I was able to make my first "Hello World" project.  I thought to myself, I can handle it so I looked forward to making it to the next session.

## [Week 2: GitHub](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week2)

The first day is testing the water while the second day is dipping slowly into the water.  A new platform to learn! I was able to follow the instructions on how to use GitHub but at the back of my mind, what is this!?! What will I write? How will this be useful for me? Am I gonna drown soon in the shallow level of water?

<br>
I read the module and did my own research. I was able to create my repository in a website form. I'm hooked! This is what I like! From plain page to a more website-like one.  I was able to make different pages through links and was able to consolidate my thoughts. Hmmm... I can try to move further more and see how deep I can go....

<br>

## [Week 3: Python](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week3)

I've enjoyed the water, perhaps, I can explore and have more fun.  Introduction to the programming language, Python.  Just the word itself, I hate it! Hearing it jumpscare me as I can imagine the slimy-looking scales that give me goosebumps.  Will the "Python" be the same python, I'm dreading?
<br>

I was able to understand the discussion, the function and the data types but, as we go along with the coding, I am lost.  What's happening? Why did Sarmad use parenthesis and the quotation mark?  I am listening to the discussion but my brain is all twisted and going somewhere.  Is Sarmad speaking in an alien language? 
<br>

Thank God, the discussion is over.  I appreciate Sarmad's lecture. I know I understood it but I feel like I'm drowning in the water. I'm struggling but I am doing my best to survive. I know I will be able to get out of the water, with a brand new skill that I will carry with me forever.

## [Week 4: Unexpect The Expected](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week4)

Time flies! It's already the 4th week. One month nearly passed. I am surviving, treading in the water. I am slowly getting the hang of it. I read continue to read the module and did more research. Now I am starting to understand, " or ' is used for string which is alpha characters. I've learned that indentation is important in Python because it indicates the block of code. I am starting to enjoy and at the same time rack my brain which often made me lost in thoughts.

Today, we are learning something new again. That is good but I feel like everything is piling up. Hearing new terminologies such as DallE and block chain. I have new list to research. But, I can think of it later, I'd rather focus on the activity to give me a break.

Being the subject of a video made me self-conscious not only on how I will look on the video but also on the thought of "am I going to greatly contribute on the effectiveness of the video"? It also gave me awareness to observe on how people are reacting on the activity which made me notice my self-worth, that without me the project will not be possible for others and vise versa. It's a domino effect. I am afraid to ruin it that I was attached to my phone more than to my image.

In spite of it all, I loved the activity as it gave me confirmation of my decision to take the course. IT isn't my thing but I jumped in because I know that I have to learn to grow with the technology as it will already be part of our lives no matter what. Akin to the story that was shared, to survive, we have to understand not to resist but to go with the flow and observe on the things around us so we can see what we can grasp on to help us get through. I don't have a project yet in mind but I know sooner or later the idea will pop for I don't have to think of something different and great but, a simple graph around that will allow my creativity to work.

## [Week 5: Agile](https://jolly20220861.github.io/Week5)

Treading in the water is quite tiring perhaps I can try a different style of swimming. As a new week approaches, I feel that I am prepared, I have already updated myself though I know there are still a lot to dive in.  That's okay as I have my list of terminologies to research, topics to read and videos to watch.  What matters is that I am understaning the idea of it all. After which, it's up to me to decide which one to focus on. Perhaps, try to learn all of it and I can be so smart (it's free to dream anyway.)

I was excited with the session but unfortunately I can't join the team at the Uni as I am stuck with my youngest at home. The good thing is that, we did the spaghetti with marshmallow activity when I was chosen to be part of the leadership training at work.  It was fun as you will have to coordinate with each members that will allow you to notice how everyone has their own leadership style.  This time, the activity taught us how to prototype.  By following the instructions, it's a balance between the limitations and the objective of winning for making the tallest tower.  Unconsciously, it made us think of the features that we need to consider to make sure that the tower will stand, sturdy enough while it goes higher.  Will Romn buy the idea of the tower made?

The highight of the day is knowing that I am not way behind as my religious update of the weekly activities and topics paid off. Without me knowing it, I have already came up with my project for submission which I can already submit.  I prefer to finish the weeks and complete all the learning and reflection prior to submission.  My journal anyay is intended not only for the sake of the project but also for me to have somthing to look back should I get lost or stuck as I pursue my development journey.
